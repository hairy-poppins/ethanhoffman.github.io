        <h1> Broadcast for All </h1>
        <h2>What is Public Media?</h2>
        <p> &emsp; Public media refers to non-commercial broadcasting services that prioritize education, public service, and accessibility over profit. It was formally established through the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). More than 70% of CPB’s federal funding goes directly to local public media stations. <br>
            &emsp; Each local public media station maintains sole authority and responsibility for selecting, presenting, and scheduling the programs that it airs. Along with programs that they produce themselves, stations can join nation networks such as PBS and NPR and then can distribute programs produced by other stations. Public broadcasting differs greatly from traditional media. Public media has no advertisements and relies solely on federal funding and personal donations for revenue.<br>
            &emsp;The funding that CPB provides also allows the CPB to issue messages that are then broadcast on all PBS and NRS affiliated stations, allowing emergency messages to be heard all across the country. Otherwise, CPB gives the right to decide and schedule what to broadcast to the local stations, allowing the stations to remain independent to air their own messages. <br>
            &emsp;PBS stations have historically produced content including children’s programs, such as Arthur; Sid, The Science Kid; Odd Squad; The Cat in the Hat; and more. Also, all American Public Television programs are available to PBS stations, which includes the largest collection of free programming, as well as a collection of paid titles. <br>
            &emsp;Department of Education grants support public media organizations, which include TV and radio stations across the country. These can include PBS, NPR, etc. These programs allow for the creation of educational programs, documentaries, and Public Service Announcements. <br>

            &emsp;Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) authorized the Ready to Learn Grant. The Grant Program is a key initiative by the U.S. Department of Education that works in collaboration with public media to improve early childhood education. Every five years grants are given to producers of children's media such as education TV shows and games. Historically, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS have won grants in every cycle. These grants help further those efforts, ensuring that public media remains an important tool for education across the country. In the past fiscal year, 36 million TV viewers were reached by Ready To Learn shows, Ready to Learn videos were streamed 1.8 billion times and Ready to Learn apps were downloaded 1.6 million times (CPB).<br>
