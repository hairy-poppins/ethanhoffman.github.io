        <h2>Early Childhood Education by Television: Lessons from Sesame Street</h2>
        <p class="text">The effects of early exposure to Sesame Street programming content on indicators of early school performance. When Sesame Street was initially introduced it provided evidence that shows immediate increase in test-scores. And when Sesame Street was introduced in areas with greater broadcast coverage it found positive results in educational performance in their preschool years. But not only in preschools but educational programming has seen beneficial results throughout elementary and seen imprecisely estimated long-term effects consistent with the grade-for-age results.</p>

        <h2>Learning with PBS KIDS: A Study of Family Engagement and Early Mathematics Achievement</h2>
        <p class="text">TEMA-3 is an assessment of early mathematical ability for children between the ages of three and nine. The test is used to screen children for those that need extra support based on their mathematical performance, or to identify gifted students who would benefit from alternative instruction.</p>
        <p class="text">Through only two weeks of the intervention focused on shapes, intervention group children grew in their understanding of basic and advanced shapes. The researcher-developed assessment of shapes indicated that there were significant improvements in the number of children correctly recognizing a variety of shapes (circle, triangle, trapezoid, and pentagons). Seen below, the intervention group children, at all income levels, increased in their mathematics ability.</p>

        <h2>Connecting America: The Essential Service of Rural Public Radio</h2>
            <p class="text">The Alliance of Rural Public Media advocates for rural radio stations all across the country, including territories such as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Public radio reaches 98.5% of the United States population, allowing messages and news to be spread across the country. People rely on public radio for information on the local economy, education, government, and public safety. Rural stations have a greater reliance on CPB funding because of their generally smaller audience and the lower average household income in rural areas.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p class="text">Rural stations have a greater reliance on government funds than other stations, with rural stations procuring 21% of their total funding from the CPB, while CPB funds only make up 7% of non-rural stationsâ€™ funds. Fundraising is a large part of how radio stations stay in business, so a lower household income reduces the amount of money people are able to donate, resulting in rural stations having a lower ability to fundraise.</p>
            <p class="text">Despite this greater reliance on public support, rural stations are an integral part of our country. Without the support of these stations, people living in rural areas would have reduced access to vital services such as emergency warnings and free access to local news. Local and indigenous cultures also rely heavily on rural stations to preserve their culture, music, art, and language.</p>
            <p class="text">The graph below compiles data gathered from the Rural Public Media Survey, which gathered responses from people living in areas served by rural radio stations. The data illustrates the lack of multiple news sources in large portions of the country. Over 20% of respondents only have access to 1 or 2 daily local news sources, and nearly 40% of respondents only have access to 1 or 2 weekly local news sources. With the shortage of local news that is life for many Americans, rural public radio stations provide key services, with nearly every station creating local news with reporters from local communities. Beyond just local news, these stations also provide regional, state, and national news, further enabling people in rural areas to remain informed on current news.</p>
