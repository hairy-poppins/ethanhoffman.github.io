        <h1> Broadcast for All </h1>
        <h2>What is Public Media?</h2>
            <p class="text"> Public media refers to non-commercial broadcasting services that prioritize education, public service, and accessibility over profit. It was formally established through the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). More than 70% of CPB’s federal funding goes directly to local public media stations.</p>
            <p class="text"> Each local public media station maintains sole authority and responsibility for selecting, presenting, and scheduling the programs that it airs. Along with programs that they produce themselves, stations can join nation networks such as PBS and NPR and then can distribute programs produced by other stations. Public broadcasting differs greatly from traditional media. Public media has no advertisements and relies solely on federal funding and personal donations for revenue. </p>
            <p class="text"> The funding that CPB provides also allows the CPB to issue messages that are then broadcast on all PBS and NRS affiliated stations, allowing emergency messages to be heard all across the country. Otherwise, CPB gives the right to decide and schedule what to broadcast to the local stations, allowing the stations to remain independent to air their own messages. </p>
            <p class="text"> PBS stations have historically produced content including children’s programs, such as Arthur; Sid, The Science Kid; Odd Squad; The Cat in the Hat; and more. Also, all American Public Television programs are available to PBS stations, which includes the largest collection of free programming, as well as a collection of paid titles. </p>
            <p class="text"> Department of Education grants support public media organizations, which include TV and radio stations across the country. These can include PBS, NPR, etc. These programs allow for the creation of educational programs, documentaries, and Public Service Announcements.  </p>
            <p class="text"> Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) authorized the Ready to Learn Grant. The Grant Program is a key initiative by the U.S. Department of Education that works in collaboration with public media to improve early childhood education. Every five years grants are given to producers of children's media such as education TV shows and games. Historically, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS have won grants in every cycle. These grants help further those efforts, ensuring that public media remains an important tool for education across the country. In the past fiscal year, 36 million TV viewers were reached by Ready To Learn shows, Ready to Learn videos were streamed 1.8 billion times and Ready to Learn apps were downloaded 1.6 million times (CPB).</p>




        
        <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>On May 1st, 2025 President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14290 titled, "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media", sought to end federal funding for NPR and PBS by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all other federal agencies. "Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence."</p>
            <p> The executive order sought to eliminate direct funding to NPR and PBS as well as indirect funding such as independent news stations buying NPR or PBS programming, like “All Things Considered,” the most listened-to afternoon radio news program in the country, and popular cultural programming like the Tiny Desk concerts. </p>
            <p> The primary root cause of the defunding issue is the politicization of public media. Critics, particularly from conservative circles, argue that NPR and PBS exhibit a liberal bias and should not receive government funding. This perspective has led to efforts to dismantle public media funding, viewing it as an unnecessary expenditure that supports opposing political views. </p>
            <p> This is a problem because in reality public media such as NPR and PBS provide significant public benefits such as news, educational programming, and emergency communication—especially in underserved or rural communities. </p>
        <h3> Education </h3>
            <p> PBS plays an important role in education overall, it provides a variety of educational programming and resources for learners of all ages. One major and popular way they use the platform is kids shows. They stream shows that enrich children and teach them early life skills before schooling with basic grammar and English through shows like Sesame Street, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and Curious George. PBS also has a huge impact on education through the Ready To Learn Initiative, funded by the U.S. The Department of Education, CPB and PBS are partners in developing high-quality educational media and resources to help critical early learning skills for children ages 2-8 to help them succeed in school, work, and life. Another way it impacts younger children is through PBS LearningMedia which offers free educational resources for PreK–12 educators and students. LearningMedia was founded as a partnership between PBS and the WGBH Educational Foundation in 2011.</p>
